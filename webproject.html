    <p style="float:left"> Annefloor is currently a 4th year student at the University of Georgia, double-majoring in Political Science and Communication Studies. Throughout her time at the University of Georgia, Annefloor has become involved in a variety of different organizations. Given her interests for local and state legislation and how they impact people and the communities that they live in, Annefloor was moved to apply to the Spencer Frye Fellowship Program, which accepts around 25 students each year. Fellows are given the opportunity to directly impact local and state legislation through policy research, community outreach, and direct interactions with legislators, lobbyists, and constituents at the Georgia State Capitol.  </p> <p style="float:left"> Due to her excellent performance within the Fellowship, Annefloor was promoted as State Representative Spencer Frye's Chief of Staff. In this role, Annefloor coordinates efforts among intra-office public relations, legislative, and constituent services teams. Furthermore, she is in charge of managing three directors and twenty-five fellows in performing fundraising, political outreach, policy research, campaigning, and social media work. Lastly, she is responsible for liasing with Representative Frye to ensure that his directives are being implemented.  </p> <p style="float:left"> Annefloor will be attending the University of Georgia's School of Law in the Fall of 2019. In the future, Annefloor plans to practice civil rights and civil liberties law. </p>
